**Business Scenario**
Working as a Data Engineer at a telecom company called Beejan Technologies. Every day, thousands of customers complain about issues like poor network, incorrect billing, or bad customer service. These complaints come through different channels: social media, call center log files, SMS, and website forms.
**Problem Encountered**

1. The management is frustrated. Data is stored in different formats.
2. The reporting team manually compiles spreadsheets.
3. No single pipeline exists for this data flow.
4. Reports are delayed.
5. Teams work in silos.

I was asked to design a solution to bring all this data together, clean it, enrich it and make it ready to provide actionable insights.

**Data Sources**
1. Social Media platform ( Twitter will be used as an example)
2. Call center Log files (CSV file)
3. SMS
4. Website forms collected via Google Form

Below is the conceptual end-to-end data pipeline architecture to solving this problem.

This conceptual data pipeline will lay the foundation for building the actual pipeline. So everything at this stage should be about concepts not tools.

To help you achieve success on this project, your manager Najeeb has provided you with the following guiding questions to help shape your design thinking.
