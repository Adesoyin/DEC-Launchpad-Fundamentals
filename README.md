# DEC Launchpad Assignment Submission - Conceptual end-to-end data pipeline
**Business Scenario**

Working as a Data Engineer at a telecom company called Beejan Technologies. Every day, thousands of customers complain about issues like poor network, incorrect billing, or bad customer service. These complaints come through different channels: social media, call center log files, SMS, and website forms.

**Problem Encountered**

1. The management is frustrated. Data is stored in different formats.
2. The reporting team manually compiles spreadsheets.
3. No single pipeline exists for this data flow.
4. Reports are delayed.
5. Teams work in silos.

I was asked to design a solution to bring all this data together, clean it, enrich it and make it ready to provide actionable insights.

**Data Sources**

1. Social Media platform ( Twitter will be used as an example)
2. Call center Log files (CSV file)
3. SMS
4. Website forms collected via Google Form

Below is the conceptual end-to-end data pipeline architecture to solving this problem.

This conceptual data pipeline will lay the foundation for building the actual pipeline.

**Design Concepts**

1. Multi-source Connectivity: This design supports multiple input types: API streams, log files, flat files, forms, and event-based triggers (SMS/connector-based) based on the different data variety and also lay emphasis on the flexibility for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured sources into the staging lakehouse.

2. Ingestion Methods: Combination of batch, hybrid processing (for files and logs),  and real-time streaming (for APIs, connectors). This would enable near real-time insights alongside periodic bulk loads.

3. Staging & Schema Alignment: Raw data is first stored in a staging layer with schema alignment and standardized formats. This will ensure consistency across the different data before further processing.

4. Transformation Layer: Here, cleaning, enrichment, restructuring, and aggregation are centralized before serving and implemented business rules to convert raw data into analytics-ready datasets.

5. Orchestration & Scheduling: Automated hybrid jobs triggered at scheduled intervals (e.g., every 1 hour) to ensure timely updates for analytics and operational use cases.

6. Gold Layer (Serving Layer): Transformed datasets are now being delivered to the data warehouse for consumption. This will serve both BI developers (dashboards, reporting) and advanced users (data scientists/ML engineers).

7. Business Outcomes: Supports decision-making with dashboards, reports, and trend analysis and timely attention to complaints by contact center and customer experience team.

8. Provides automation use cases (e.g., complaint categorization, ticketing, immediate responses).

**Assumptions / Thought Process**

1. The data arriving from different sources may not follow a consistent schema; hence schema alignment is required early in the pipeline.

2. Both real-time monitoring and batch-driven historical analysis are important for business use cases.

3. A staging area is required to decouple ingestion from transformation, allowing retries, validation, and data quality checks.

4. Standardized storage formats (columnar/delta) are assumed to optimize query performance and incremental updates.

5. Business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) workloads are both first-class consumers that serves other end users, requiring a single unified pipeline instead of separate solutions.

**Challenges / Unknowns**

1. Data Quality & Governance

2. How to enforce consistent metadata, lineage, and data ownership.

3. Handling missing and duplicate ecords.

4. The ability of the ingestion framework to scale with increased data volume, velocity, and variety.

5. Balancing between batch and streaming loads.

6. High-frequency jobs (every 1 hour or lower) might increase infrastructure costs.


**How to Handle Failure Detection**

1. Check for incomplete or corrupted files, API call failures, or missing data feeds at the ingestion stage.

2. Monitor schema mismatch, write errors, or data volume anomalies at the staging stage

3. Capture failures in cleaning/enrichment rules, null/invalid data propagation, or aggregation errors.

4. Track job execution status (success, partial success, failed) along with run duration during orchestation stage

5. Email notifications sent immediately on job failure or data anomalies,also retries can be incorporated in the pipeline run.

**Additional Information**

The hybrid approach enables future-proofing: real-time use cases (alerts, immediate categorization) coexist with analytical use cases (dashboards, historical reporting).

Every negative complaints categorization shall be triggered to the right team to work on immediately.
